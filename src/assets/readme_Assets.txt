Animations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Frame rate
	Pomu	2 fps
	Elira	12 fps
	Finana	12 fps

All animations loop by reversing e.g.
Pomu
	Pomu-Animation_0.webp
	Pomu-Animation_1.webp
	Pomu-Animation_2.webp
	Pomu-Animation_1.webp
	(then loop back to start)
Elira
	Elira-Animation_0.webp
	Elira-Animation_1.webp
	Elira-Animation_2.webp
	Elira-Animation_3.webp
	Elira-Animation_2.webp
	Elira-Animation_1.webp
	(then loop back to start)

Or we can just use the gif files
